# Code Style and Conventions

This project uses Java and Gradle. Standard Java coding conventions are expected, including:

*   **Naming Conventions:** camelCase for methods and variables, PascalCase for classes.
*   **Docstrings/Comments:** Javadoc-style comments for classes and methods are recommended.
*   **Formatting:** Consistent indentation (likely 4 spaces, default for Java in many IDEs).
*   **Logging:** SLF4J with Logback for logging output.
